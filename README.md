# coding challenges

A collection of interview questions and coding challenges encountered.

These are in a better shape than what I would write in the artificial constraints of a 45min (digital) whiteboard
interview ðŸ¤·.

Kudos to the [archive of CodeEval problems](https://github.com/rdtsc/codeeval-problem-statements).
